# test1
This is the initial test repo for group members to become familiar with GitHub.

This is my first README.md file. I believe this file's purpose is to serve as a synopsis of the repository's contents.

Be sure to let me know your (1) GitHub name and (2) meetup.com name so I can invite you to the group!
Just put them on the group discussion board or email at bjones1831@gmail.com!
